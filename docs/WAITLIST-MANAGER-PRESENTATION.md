## SLIDE 2: The Problem

### Visual Content:
**The Nightmare We Faced**

- No system to track waiting prospects
- Tenants reaching out via personal cells
- Missed opportunities = Lost revenue

### Speaker Notes (85 words):
"Let's talk about a real problem we faced. Managing prospective tenant expectations—keeping them updated when units become available—was our biggest challenge. Last year, we discovered that our Park project signed seven new leases from showings that happened the *previous year*. These tenants were reaching back out through personal cell phones because we had no formal system. Once we realized this, I backdated all those showings, called everyone back, and more applications came through. But we knew we needed a better solution."

## SLIDE 3: The Solution

### Visual Content:
**The Waitlist Manager**

✅ Centralized waitlist portal  
✅ Prospects can self-register via link  
✅ Automatic unit matching  
✅ Agent email alerts

### Speaker Notes (75 words):
"So we built this—the Waitlist Manager. This software gives us a central place to manage our waitlist. We can add people directly, or prospects can add themselves through a public link. Here's where it gets powerful: the system automatically sees what's available on the market and matches it against our waitlist. When there's a match, the assigned agent gets an email alert to reach out. No more relying on memory or personal notes."

## SLIDE 4: The Hero Feature

### Visual Content:
**Smart Matching & Auto-Management**

🎯 Instant alerts when units match waitlist criteria  
🤖 Automatic cleanup of outdated entries  
📧 Agent notifications with contact details  

[📸 Screenshot placeholder: Match Alerts tab]

### Speaker Notes (90 words):
"The hero feature here is the automatic matching and management. When a unit hits the market that matches someone's preferences—property, unit type, budget, move-in date—the system instantly notifies the assigned agent. This fulfills our duty to prospective tenants by getting them information *fast*. The auto-management piece is equally valuable. The system can automatically clean up entries based on specific rules—like expired move-in dates or signed leases. This keeps our waitlist accurate and actionable without manual maintenance."

## SLIDE 5: How It Works

### Visual Content:
**The Flow**

1️⃣ Prospect added to waitlist (by agent or self-service)  
2️⃣ System monitors available units  
3️⃣ Match detected → Agent alerted via email  
4️⃣ Agent reaches out to prospect

### Speaker Notes (60 words):
"Here's the simple flow. A prospect gets added—either by us or through the self-service link. The system continuously monitors our available inventory. The moment a match is detected, the assigned agent receives an email with all the details they need. From there, it's a quick outreach to a warm lead who's already waiting to hear from us."
